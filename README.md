# Parse-Gamified-Learning
 Final Project in PLD, good luck!

## How to run the webapp: (make sure you have `pip` installed)
  1. Make a Virtual Environment(venv) in any directory:
  ```py -venv [name your virtual environment here]```
  - (in the case that `py` doesn't work, try `python`)
  3. Activate the Virtual Environment:
  ```[Your Virtual Environment]/Scripts/activate.ps1```
  4. Install django in this Virtual Environment:
  ```pip install django``` or ```py -m pip install django```
  5. Check to make sure you have installed django:
  ```django-admin --version```
  6. Install django-extensions:
  ```pip install django-extensions``` or ```py -m pip install django-extensions```
  7. Drag the "Parse_app" folder into the Virtual Environment's directory
  8. Run the Parse_App web application:
  `py [any directory]/Parse_app/manage.py runserver`
